Please do not run python setup.py install, as this will try to insert
a module in the site-packages directory, obviously not the desired
behaivor. Use the script build.sh

After compiling the C code, run UnitTest.py to made sure all of 
the files import and run correctly. If you run into trouble,
open setup.py, see if the "exec" commands are set to run with
Linux or Mac, and change if need be.
