# Read event's HDF5 using h5py, returning a python object
# All arrays, variables are "dot" attributes, like filed in C structs
# Returned object is an instance of AnEvent.
# HDF groups, which were originally structs in IDL, are made 
# into instances of DataGob with members as attributes, nested 
# as deep as needed.
